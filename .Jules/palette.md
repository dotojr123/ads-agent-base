## 2025-02-19 - Auto-expanding Textarea vs Input
**Learning:** For AI chat interfaces, users often need to paste prompts or write multi-sentence context. A single-line input feels restrictive and hides content. Replacing it with an auto-expanding textarea significantly improves the "thinking space" for the user.
**Action:** Always prefer `textarea` with auto-resize logic over `input` for chat agents where message complexity > 1 sentence.
